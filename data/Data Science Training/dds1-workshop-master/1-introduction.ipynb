    "Welcome! This workshop is from [TrainingDataScience.com](https://trainingdatascience.com/?utm_source=trainingdatascience&utm_medium=notebook&utm_campaign=workshop&utm_term=individual). Sign up to receive more free workshops, training and videos.\n",

    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "For most Data Science tasks there are two competing Open Source languages. R is favoured more by those with a mathematical background. Python is preferred by those with a programming background; all of my workshops are currently in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "I prefer Python because I can achieve a lot with very little code. We can make use of an extensive library ecosystem and Python's scripting abilities to be very productive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can also be a downside. With experience you will tend to create big one-liners; code that does a lot in a single line. This can make it hard for new users to understand. Where possible, I try to be as clear as possible.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "(aka. IPython notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are an incredible way to work. They allow you to present documentation and working code in the same file. People can pick it up, read through the content and immediately see the running code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of _cells_: markdown and code. This is a markdown cell. Code cells run actual python code!"
