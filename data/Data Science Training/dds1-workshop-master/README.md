# Introduction

You've found the first notebook! Well done. First, let's talk about how this is going to work...

    
## How this will work

I have created worksheets for each of the main chapters. They are numbered; work through them in order.

By the time we get to the last one, you will be amazed with what we have achieved in such a short space of time.

### Get your brain working

The idea is that you have to do something, to engage your brain, to be able to learn anything.

To attempt to get you to do some thinking, I've left out chunks of code. If you run this notebook without reading it through, it won't work.

> If you see an indented text, this means that you will have to do something to get the code working

### If you get stuck

Hopefully you will get a bit stuck; that means you're learning! When you do, the first port of call is to bring up a search engine. When you do this for real, you will become a researcher. No problem is exactly the same, so you will need to do your own research to get it working. This usually means a visit to stackoverflow. :-)

If you're still stuck, please just ask for help. I'd be happy to help (and by help, I mean I will use your computer to visit stackoverflow ;-) )

### If you finish quickly

Generally, at the end of each notebook is a task that is a bit more difficult that the rest of the notebook. If you finish before everyone else, give these a go.

### Answers

If you get really, really stuck and want to see the answers (for all except this first chapter) then these are located in the `./answers` directory.

### Where is this running?

You are currently working within your own dockerised environment. This notebook and the python kernel is running in a container in the cloud.

I will destroy this host after the session. But I have given you some free reign over the system. Please please please, don't install a bitcoin miner. Your fellow attendees will thank you. :-)

### Your data

Your data is mounted into a docker volume. When we've finished we can extract that data onto your local laptop, if you so wish.

I haven't focused on data integrity much, because you can always just download the answers. So if the whole cloud host dies, then we've also lost your data. Hopefully that won't happen!
