    "# Kaggle Machine Learning Competition: Predicting Titanic Survivors\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle is an online resource for competetive data science competitions (now owned by Google).\n",
    "\n",
    "They publish datasets and ask readers to submit algorithms that produce a desired result. The desired results depend on the problem, but you never get to see the test dataset that they use for scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of their \"introductory\" data science competitions. It's particularly interesting because it raises some very important ethical questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to know more about the the competition visit the original [competition site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The data has been loaded into this ipython notebook for you. Please use that for training/validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Competition time!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will run a little internal competition and the winner will get to talk through their result. Feel free to work in teams, or by yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "For each passenger in the test set, you must predict whether or not they survived the sinking ( 0 for deceased, 1 for survived ). Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict (i.e. accuracy).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compare scores at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!"
